# CodeSheriff
Just a very simple discord bot for reminding D#+ users not to use bad things >:)

# What does it do?

If someone posts code into the chat (either a code block with the triple `) then
the bot will check the code and notify the user if it finds something thats usually very bad (i.e. .Result)
